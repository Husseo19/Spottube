#Download Spotify playlist from youtube
The script doesn't check for user_invalid input meaning it will give an error if you paste in the wrong spotify link.
The search algorithm is based on google searches, meaning that there is no self written algorithm. 
The script searches for "official audio youtube". It has an accuracy of 80% to get a good youtube link.
I wrote it for myself but felt like posting it here :)
